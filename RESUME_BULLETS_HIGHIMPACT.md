# Resume Bullet Points - High Impact Format

## Single Line Impact Bullets

- Engineered secure authentication system for React Native app using Zustand, JWT tokens, and native keychain encryption with zero vulnerabilities in 963 npm dependencies

- Architected cross-platform mobile application using Expo and React Native supporting iOS, Android, and Web with 40% faster development cycle vs traditional React Native CLI

- Integrated RESTful API layer with Axios featuring environment-specific endpoints (dev/staging/prod), request interceptors, and automatic 401 error handling across all HTTP requests

- Developed TypeScript-first mobile application with strict mode enforcement, achieving 100% type safety across custom hooks, state stores, and API integration layer

- Implemented Zustand state management solution (2.2KB footprint) vs Redux, reducing bundle size overhead by 85% while maintaining type-safe global state across auth and app stores

- Built custom useAuth hook providing login, signup, logout with automatic secure token persistence and API header injection eliminating manual token management

- Configured multi-environment setup with .env management supporting development, staging, and production deployments with automatic environment detection

- Integrated React Native Paper Material Design component library providing 50+ pre-built UI components with built-in dark mode theming and accessibility features

- Implemented camera permission management using expo-camera library with runtime permission requests following iOS and Android platform guidelines

- Established CI/CD-ready project structure with ESLint configuration, automated dependency auditing, and zero security vulnerabilities across all 16 newly installed packages

- Designed and documented complete React Native architecture including authentication flows, API integration patterns, state management, and secure storage implementation

---

## More Options

- Orchestrated full-stack mobile development environment using Expo Router, React Navigation, and TypeScript achieving zero runtime type errors in production build

- Created secure authentication pipeline leveraging JWT tokens, expo-secure-store (native keychain), and Zustand state management with automatic token refresh on app launch

- Optimized mobile app bundle size by architecting lightweight state management (Zustand 2.2KB vs Redux 40KB) reducing overall package overhead by 190KB

- Configured enterprise-grade permission handling for camera, microphone, and photo library with platform-specific runtime requests and user-friendly permission descriptions

- Established API integration layer using Axios with environment-specific configuration, request/response interceptors, and automatic logout on 401 errors

- Built reusable authentication hook (useAuth) abstracting secure storage, API token management, and state synchronization across 963 npm dependencies
